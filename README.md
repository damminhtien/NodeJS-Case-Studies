## NodeJS Framework :rocket: :rocket: :rocket:
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com): <span style="text-align:justify">**fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. The most popular framework Nodejs**. This is a minimal framework for building a variety of web and mobile applications as well as application programming interfaces (APIs). Many popular applications and sites like MySpace, Geekli.st, Klout, Segment.io and Yummly are built by express. Express provides various features, such as simplifying multiple routing, database integration, etc ... </span>

* [Sails.js](https://sailsjs.com): <span style='text-align:justify'> **makes it easy to build custom, enterprise-grade Node.js apps. Realtime framework MVC for NodeJS**. Sails.js is one of the most popular realtime frameworks for building Node.js applications. Sails.js uses the MVC model as an architecture. It uses Waterline to map relational objects and provide database solutions. Sails.js is built on Node.js and uses Express.js to handle HTTP requests. It is ideal for creating browser based applications as it is compatible with all Grunt modules, including LESS, SASS, Stylus, CoffeeScript, Jade, Dust, and more. Sails.js supports any endpoint approach, such as Angular, Backbone, iOS / ObjC, Android / Java, or anything else. </span>

* [Hapi.js](https://hapijs.com): **a rich framework for building applications and services hapi enables developers to focus on writing reusable application logic instead of spending time building infrastructure**. Hapi.js is a powerful Node.js framework for building application programming interfaces (APIs) and other software applications. This framework has a powerful plugin system and many features, including validate input data, configuration-based functions, caching implementation, error handling, logging and more. Hapi.js is used to design useful applications, such as Postmile, a collaborative listing creation tool. Besides, it is used to provide technology solutions for a number of large-scale websites, such as Disney, Concrete, PayPal, Walmart and more.

* [Mean.js](http://meanjs.org): **Open-Source Full-Stack Solution For MEAN Applications**. MEAN.JS is a full-stack JavaScript solution that helps you build fast, robust, and maintainable production web applications using MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js. MEAN.JS will help you getting started and avoid useless grunt work and common pitfalls, while keeping your application organized. Mean.js goal is to create and maintain a simple and readable open-source solution that you can use and trust in your projects.

* [Meteor.js](https://www.meteor.com): **an open source platform for web, mobile, and desktop. The fastest way to build javascript app**. Meteor pre-built modules make code writing easier and faster. Moreover, its programming model allows for less JavaScript writing. The popular applications built by Meteor are Dispatch (Software for field service businesses.), Respondly (a collaborative application for the team), Blonk (Mobile search application) and etc...

* [Socket.io](https://socket.io/): **featuring the fastest and most reliable real-time engine**. Socket.io is a framework of Node.js that allows you to build realtime web applications. It allows two-way communication between the client and the server. Socket.io acts as a client-side library running in the browser and as a server-side library for node.js. The framework allows simultaneous real-time execution for collaboration and data exchange. In addition, its main features include asynchronous I / O processing, binary streams, instant messaging, and more.
